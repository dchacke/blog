I now have a domain for the discussion site: [www.fallible.fun](http://www.fallible.fun/). And it supports markdown, allowing the user to post formatted content such as this one:

As before, the green segments are passages people have commented on.

The font and the markdown look beautiful together. One thing I'm not happy with yet is the navbar at the top. It looks bulky and clunky and the page looks better when it is scrolled out of view and the text takes center stage.

So yeah... that's going to have to change somehow. Nor am I crazy about the domain.
