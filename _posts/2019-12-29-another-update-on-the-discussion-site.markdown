I've been busy implementing new features. The most notable perhaps is that posts and comments can now have an assigned type. The purpose of this is mainly to facilitate asking questions, posting responses, and, most importantly, posting *refutations*. This means that posts can be marked as refuted:

Note that in order to "save" the original post, one can *refute the refutation*:

(In real life, you wouldn't want to post unargued assertions such as the ones in the above previews. They're only meant to showcase the functionality.)

So, if you post some things to the site in search of feedback/criticism, the site can now help you keep track of criticisms. The same goes for unanswered questions: when an answer to a question is refuted, the question is considered unanswered again.
