Yesterday, I implemented a feature in the discussion forum I am building that I think is pretty cool. You can highlight any arbitrary passage and then link to it:

Note that the corresponding range is added to the end of the URL. If you then share this URL with someone else, they will see the same visual effect.

This will be useful for cross referencing ideas.
